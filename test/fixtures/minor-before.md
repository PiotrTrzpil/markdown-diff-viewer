# Hormones and Behavior

Oxytocin is a powerful hormone. The hormone Oxytocin floods our systems during positive social interactions. It creates bonds between mothers and infants, between partners, and even between dogs and their owners.

## The Role of Cortisol

Cortisol, often called the "stress hormone," plays a crucial role in our fight-or-flight response. When we perceive a threat, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activates, flooding the bloodstream with Cortisol.

Chronic elevation of Cortisol levels has been linked to anxiety, depression, and impaired immune function. This is why prolonged stress is so damaging to health.

## Serotonin and Mood

Serotonin is sometimes called the "happiness molecule," though this is an oversimplification. It regulates mood, appetite, sleep, and social behaviour. Low Serotonin levels are associated with depression.

Modern SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) work by blocking the reabsorption of Serotonin, making more available in the synaptic cleft.
